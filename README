This plugin enables bundles (as used by pathogen) and loads the 
respective plugins as requested by the user. This plugin provides means to 
enable bundles when:

    - explicitely loading some bundles via |:Enableplugin|
    - setting a filetype (see |:Enablefiletype|)
    - calling an unknown function (see |:Enableautoload|)
    - invoking a map (see |:Enablemap|)
    - calling a command (see |:Enablecommand|)
    - load enabler definitions (see |:Autoenabler|) generated by the 
      |:Enablegenerate| command

Most vim plugin managers try to do at least two things: manage your 
'runtimepath' and manage (install, update, remove) plugins. Enabler focuses on 
the first task, i.e., managing the 'runtimepath' variable and enabling plugins 
as needed. Enabler doesn't provide a way to download / install / update / 
remove / build these plugins. Users should use one of the other vim plugin 
managers available, shell scripts or whatever.
