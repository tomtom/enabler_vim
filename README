This plugin enables bundles (as used by pathogen) and loads the 
respective plugins as requested by the user. This plugin provides means to 
enable bundles when:

    - explicitely loading some bundles via |:Enableplugin|
    - setting a filetype (see |:Enablefiletype|)
    - calling an unknown function (see |:Enableautoload|),
    - invoking a map (see |:Enablemap|)
    - calling a command (see |:Enablecommand|)

Enabler focuses on managing the 'runtimepath' variable and enabling plugins as 
needed. Enabler doesn't provide a way to download/update/remove/build these 
plugins. Users should use one of the other vim plugin managers available, shell 
scripts or whatever.
