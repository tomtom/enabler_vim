*enabler.txt*         Load plugins/bundles
                      Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com


This plugin enables bundles (as used by pathogen) and loads the 
respective plugins as requested by the user. This plugin provides means to 
enable bundles when:

    - explicitely loading some bundles via |:Enableplugin|
    - setting a filetype (see |:Enablefiletype|)
    - calling an unknown function (see |:Enableautoload|),
    - invoking a map (see |:Enablemap|)
    - calling a command (see |:Enablecommand|)

Enabler focuses on managing the 'runtimepath' variable and enabling plugins as 
needed. Enabler doesn't provide a way to download/update/remove/build these 
plugins. Users should use one of the other vim plugin managers available, shell 
scripts or whatever.

You probably have to insert the following lines at the top of the |vimrc| file:

If the enabler plugin is installed as a bundle: >

    " Add the directory of the enabler bundle to 'rtp' (the value may differ 
    " from your setup)
    set rtp+=$HOME/.vim/bundle/enabler_vim
    " Load the plugin
    runtime! plugin/enabler.vim

If it is installed in ~/.vim: >

    runtime! plugin/enabler.vim
