*enabler.txt*         Load plugins/bundles
                      Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com


This plugin enables bundles (as used by pathogen) and loads the 
respective plugins as requested by the user. This plugin provides means to 
enable bundles when:

    - explicitely loading some bundles via |:Enableplugin|
    - setting a filetype (see |:Enablefiletype|)
    - calling an unknown function (see |:Enableautoload|)
    - invoking a map (see |:Enablemap|)
    - calling a command (see |:Enablecommand|)
    - load enabler definitions (see |:Autoenabler|) generated by the 
      |:Enablegenerate| command

Most vim plugin managers try to do at least two things: manage your 
'runtimepath' and manage (install, update, remove) plugins. Enabler focuses on 
the first task, i.e., managing the 'runtimepath' variable and enabling plugins 
as needed. Enabler doesn't provide a way to download / install / update / 
remove / build these plugins. Users should use one of the other vim plugin 
managers available, shell scripts or whatever.

Install~

If you want to install the vba from vim.org, open the vba file in VIM (see 
`:help vimball` for details) and type: >

    :so %%

If you want to install from git, clone http://github.com/tomtom/enabler_vim/
to ~/.vim/bundle/enabler_vim: >

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/tomtom/enabler_vim.git

In order to make full use of the enabler plugin, you could insert something 
like the the following lines at the top of the |vimrc| file:

    """ If enabler is installed as bundle, add the directory of the enabler 
    """ bundle to 'rtp' (the value may differ from your setup):
    set rtp+=$HOME/.vim/bundle/enabler_vim
    """ If enabler is installed in ~/.vim replace the above line with the 
    """ following:
    " runtime! plugin/enabler.vim

    """ Optionally customize enabler's behaviour:
    " let g:enabler... = ...

    """ Load the plugin:
    runtime! plugin/enabler.vim

    """ Enable a standard set of plugins you always use:
    Enable ...

    """ Optionally load |autoenabler.vim|:
    Autoenabler
