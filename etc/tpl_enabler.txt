*enabler.txt*         Load plugins/bundles
                      Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com


This plugin enables bundles (as used by pathogen) and loads the 
respective plugins as requested by the user. This plugin provides means to 
enable bundles when:

    - explicitely loading some bundles via |:Enableplugin|
    - setting a filetype (see |:Enablefiletype|)
    - calling an unknown function (see |:Enableautoload|)
    - invoking a map (see |:Enablemap|)
    - calling a command (see |:Enablecommand|)
    - load enabler definitions via |:Autoenabler| generated by the 
      |:Enablegenerate| command

Enabler focuses on managing the 'runtimepath' variable and enabling plugins as 
needed. Enabler doesn't provide a way to download/update/remove/build these 
plugins. Users should use one of the other vim plugin managers available, shell 
scripts or whatever.

In order to make full use of the enabler plugin, you could insert something 
like the the following lines at the top of the |vimrc| file:

    """ If enabler is installed as bundle, add the directory of the enabler 
    """ bundle to 'rtp' (the value may differ from your setup):
    set rtp+=$HOME/.vim/bundle/enabler_vim
    """ If enabler is installed in ~/.vim replace the above line with the 
    """ following:
    " runtime! plugin/enabler.vim
    """ Optionally set plugin specific options
    " let g:enabler... = ...
    """ Load the plugin
    runtime! plugin/enabler.vim
    """ Enable a standard set of plugins you always use
    Enable ...
    """ Optionally load |autoenabler.vim|
    Autoenabler
